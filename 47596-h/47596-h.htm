<blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> <i>sitting in their comfortable
drawing room</i>, <span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>in armchair R.C. near a
table, cutting a book with a paper-knife</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span>
<i>on small sofa, L.C., with a little table near him on
which is an ash-tray. He is smoking, and reading
the "Pall Mall Gazette."</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>continuing conversation as the curtain
goes up</i>]. Don't you agree with what I'm saying?
I'm sure men are like that. Will, do you mean to say
you don't agree?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>absently, looking up and down columns
of paper</i>]. Yes, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I know quite well what it means when
a man says in that way [<i>imitating his tone</i>]&mdash;'Yes, I
daresay,' and goes on reading. It means you're not
thinking of what I'm saying&mdash;you're thinking of
nothing but the paper.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>still looking up and down the columns</i>].
Well, there are very interesting things in the paper.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Of course there are. And it's still more
interesting trying to guess which of them are true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
But still it is rather boring that you should be reading
the newspaper while I'm talking.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Oh? I thought you were talking
while I was reading the newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> That <i>is</i> a one-sided view, I must say.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> <i>smiles, shakes the ash off his cigarette,
and goes on reading without speaking</i>].</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> It is a pity you don't enjoy my society,
isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. A great pity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Will, I suppose that you like me as I
am?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Absolutely and entirely. Even when
you talk unceasingly when I'm having a quiet read and
smoke before dressing for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Anyhow, you'd have to be interrupted
soon, because you must go up when the clock strikes,
and see Mary in bed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>laughing happily</i>]. Yes, the little
monkey. I should never hear the end of it if I didn't.
She's a tremendous tyrant, isn't she.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Yes. I wonder what she'll be like when
she grows up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Like her mother, I daresay.
Apt to talk when her husband's reading.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> To-night I want to talk. Do listen,
Will&mdash;just this once!</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> <i>smiles and puts his paper down on his knee</i>].</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Just this once, if you're sure it won't
happen again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I was thinking about what men are like,
and what women are like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> You see, men don't want to be taking
their souls to pieces perpetually as women do, to see
what they're made of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> But it is <i>so</i> interesting to do it, even if
one's afraid of what one finds there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Afraid!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Oh, yes. There are times when I'm
thinking of things, when I'm all over the place. I
can't help it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> All over the place! Yes, that's quite
true. You are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Well, as I said, I've been thinking&mdash;and
I see that in heaps of ways men and women are
so different.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> That's a very profound remark.
Don't get beyond my depth, Rachel, pray.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Will, you horrid old thing! But I
don't care for your laughing at me. I'll go on. Men
are so simple<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> And women so complicated?&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Sometimes. Men take things and people
for granted so much more than women do&mdash;sailors I
do believe especially, are made like that. You take
things for granted; you like everybody; you believe in
everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Well, my experience has shewn me
that you come fewer croppers in life if you believe in
people, than if you're suspicious of them. It may be
an illusion, but that's my experience.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I wonder?&hellip; And there is
another great difference. Women&mdash;so many women&mdash;are
cowards; afraid, always afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Afraid of what, you foolish creature?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Of all sorts of things. I was full of
terrors when I was a child. Not only of robbers and
ghosts, of absurd things that never happened, but of
people, who were cross or unkind &hellip; of everything.
And then I was left by myself, and I was poor,
and had to earn my own living. It was dreadful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Well, that's all over. You needn't
think of it any more. I'll take care of you, never fear.
Nothing and nobody shall frighten you now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Oh, I know. I've always felt what a
rock of defence you were ever since that first evening,
when we had broken down in the motor and you
stopped yours beside us in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> And found you, the pretty little
governess, by the side of the road with the son of the
house! having broken your employer's motor. By
George, you looked frightened then. I don't think I
ever saw a more woebegone little object than you were,
standing there huddled together, looking as if you were
trying to escape from the lights of the motor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]. Yes, those horrible lights
that would keep blazing away all round us, and oh, I
did so want to hide, to sink under the earth, never to
be found again!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Come, come, it wasn't as bad as that:
though I must admit it was pretty awful when we had
to go back and face your infuriated employer.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>shudders at the thought</i>].
 </p>
</div>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> I think she had a case, mind you!
Going out for a joy ride with her son at that time of
night in her car!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Oh, the rapture of that moment when
you stood up for me, and then, when you found out
you had known my dad!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Rather a good moment, that&mdash;a
trump card, wasn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I can hear you saying it now, 'Tom
Farrar, my old shipmate.' Oh, the relief of it! the
relief!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Poor little girl!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>recovering herself</i>]. But we needn't
think about it; and you were there, and you brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
me back with you, and then, as they say in the fairy
tales, we married and lived happily ever after.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Except that I had to go off to the
Cape directly afterwards. Good Lord! How I used
to laugh at the other men on board, when they were
wanting to go ashore to see their wives and babies, or
to come back home when they were aboard. I used to
think what fools they were; but they weren't. I was
the fool all right. And now I know better&mdash;I have done
just the same. And after getting that splendid ship
I was so proud of, and after always saying that I
would not take a shore-going job for the world, I
jumped at this job at the Admiralty just to be near
you and Mary, and, oh, I am so glad I did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>caressingly</i>]. We are awfully happy,
aren't we?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Awfully.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>musingly</i>]. Mary&mdash;Mary&mdash;[<i>she says
the name twice</i>]. How I love that child! I love her
absurdly, fiercely. If I tried to love her more I
couldn't. I have sometimes a wild sense of the joy
of having her that makes me afraid of fate&hellip;.
[<i>She speaks on in a more ordinary tone</i>]. Men aren't
like that, I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. No, I don't believe they
are. They just love and love their child, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Yes, that's all. And that's everything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. And that's everything.</p>

 <p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>sitting looking before her</i>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> <i>leaning
back in his chair looking up at ceiling; not at her</i>].
 </p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> That night, at Simonstown, that I
got your telegram saying the child was born, that you
had a daughter&mdash;it was so wonderful, so impossible to
understand. That night I remember, after I knew, I
went for a blow on the quarter deck quite late, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
turning in&mdash;in the sort of dark it is out there when
the sky is deep purple and the huge stars are blazing
in it like holes opening into glory&mdash;and I kept saying
to myself, A child! I have a child&mdash;my child! I
really believe for a while I was almost mad. It seemed
to me that the plash of the sea, the choppy little waves
beating against the gangway ladder were answering
me, were saying the same thing, too&mdash;my child! Life
had changed in that hour. And I wondered if I could
go on waiting, waiting for the moment when I should
be with you both. I didn't tell any of them about it
out there. I didn't trust myself. I didn't know what
I should say if I began to speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. <i>You'd</i> have been all over
the place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>trying to hide his emotion</i>]. I believe
I should, for once. Good old Tom! I was with him
when he died in the East. He would have been glad
to know I had got his little girl out of a scrape.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> And that you had married her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Well &hellip; he would have thought
me a bit old for you, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> You're not to say that! You're just
the right age.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> You really think so?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Of course I do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>still smiling</i>]. Now, Rachel, were you
in love with that young Thornton?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> No, I don't think I was. It was a boy
and girl sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling, but sighing too</i>]. Yes, boy
and girl. I suppose when there are young people
together that sort of thing happens.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Oh, don't say it in that tone. You
don't mean to say you're jealous of him&mdash;because he
was young?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>more seriously</i>]. Jealous? Of you?
Of my wife? No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Well, some people are. They always
are in books.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> I'm not in a book, and that sort of
thing isn't good enough for me. [<i>Goes on in an ordinary
tone</i>]. I wonder what became of Thornton. Have
you ever heard anything of him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>with an impulse</i>]. Will, how different
you are from other people!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> You find me on the road in the dark
with a young man. How do you know I was not
running away with him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Well, if you were, you
weren't doing it very successfully. To tell the
truth, there were so many things to think of that night
after fettling up the motor and taking you back, that
I hadn't time to wonder what you were after. [<i>A
pause</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> As a matter of fact, I have heard something
about Jack Thornton&mdash;he's dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>interested but not suspicious</i>]. Dead!
How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I saw it in an evening paper six weeks
ago. It was a night you were away inspecting at
Portsmouth or something. I meant to tell you. It
was a horrible story. He was in East Africa&mdash;he went
there to farm&mdash;he was one of a party who had a skirmish
with some natives&mdash;they had quarrelled about
something and he and another Englishman were killed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>sympathetically</i>]. Oh, a bad business.
Yes. I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>impulsively</i>]. I was not, very&mdash;I
couldn't bear to think of all that time he had been
mixed up in. No, when I heard that he was dead, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was a relief. I don't want to be reminded of him&mdash;to
be reminded of all that time. Oh, Will, if you
knew what the sense of security and happiness is of
being married to you. I do love you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> I'm very glad to hear it. Look here;
confess you weren't in love with me when we married.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> We married so very soon, you see. I
hadn't time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> You didn't fall in love at first sight
as I did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> But I was as quick as I could. Before
we had been married a month I adored you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Did you really, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> You know I did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Yes, I know it too, but I like hearing
you say it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> You ought to believe it by this time
without having to be told.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Of course I do. Oh, Rachel&mdash;I
wonder if you know the absolute trust I have in you.
How I love and reverence you more than I can put
into words, and how I wonder every day at the great
gifts that have come to me from you and the child.
My life is overflowing with happiness&mdash;and when I
think of those lonely days when I was going ahead
thinking I had got all I wanted, and I had nothing!&mdash;darling,
I must try to be worthy of it all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>speaking very lightly as the maid goes

it? Who's it from?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>reading the name at the top of the
paper</i>]. It's from Threlfold and Bixley, solicitors.
They're&mdash;[<i>then he looks at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>as though hesitating

solicitors.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>amazed</i>]. Rachel! [<i>Getting up</i>].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
What is it? You are not well! Is it hearing about
this so suddenly? [<i>He makes a movement. She thinks
he is going to turn the page</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Don't, don't! you promised, you promised
you wouldn't. I want to tell you what is on the
next page before you read it&mdash;I know how it goes
on&mdash;'Mary Carteret his&mdash;child!'</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. Rachel! what has happened
to you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>compelling herself to speak less wildly;

Thornton's child.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>A silence</i>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> <i>stands looking at her</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>gives a smothered cry</i>]. Oh! It's not
in the letter&mdash;and <i>I</i> told you&mdash;I myself&hellip;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>with a sudden impulse of hope</i>].
Rachel, I still don't believe it. You don't know what
you are saying.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Yes, yes, I tell you, it's true&mdash;and I've
told you&mdash;<i>I</i> did&mdash;if I hadn't, you wouldn't have
known.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> What&mdash;it <i>is</i> true then! and <i>that</i> is
all you can think of&mdash;that you needn't have told me&mdash;that
if you had not, you could have gone on pretending&hellip;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> We should have gone on being happy&mdash;and&mdash;now
it's gone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Happy&mdash;you could have lived with
that lie in your heart and have been happy?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> The lie was buried&mdash;he was dead&mdash;I
was safe [<i>wringing her hands</i>]. We were happy, we
should always have been happy now he is dead.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> But the truth! Do you care so little
about the truth?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> The truth can be so terrible.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Is <i>that</i> what women are like?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Oh, women are afraid. All these years
I have been so terrified&mdash;so haunted by terror&mdash;till I
knew he was dead. Then&mdash;then&mdash;I thought I was
safe. I used to think&mdash;suppose&mdash;suppose, you ever
came to know it! I tried to tell you, at first, I did,
indeed, but my heart died at the thought&hellip;.
And then when I fell in love with you and saw how
desperately you cared for Mary&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>he shrinks</i>]. Don't&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> I couldn't&mdash;and then, I thought it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in the letter&mdash;and you'd see it, and so I told you&mdash;I
told you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>looking at the letter and reading</i>].
'His god-child'&mdash;is that true?</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>shakes her head</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> A lie, too, like all the rest? Oh, my
God! [<i>He sits down and buries his face in his hands</i>].
And if the letter hadn't come I should have gone on
being fooled to the end. You had better have told
me, Rachel, before we married. I should have done
exactly what I did&mdash;I should have married you all
the same.</p>

with that now. I shouldn't have had those illusions&mdash;I
shouldn't have had that dream of love and pride

awakening. Good God! that night that I told you
about just now&mdash;the night I first heard&mdash;I've never
told another human being about that night of revelation,
of knowing what it meant to have a child&mdash;and
it was all a lie. It was none of it true. She's not

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>fiercely, in an agony of apprehension</i>].
No, no! I won't have you say that! She has your

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>hardly audibly</i>]. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> The scoundrel!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Now then, you know it all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> No, not all. Were you going away
with him that night?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Yes&mdash;he said we must be married. I
knew we must&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. Yes, you had to marry
someone&hellip;. [<span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> <i>looks at him imploringly</i>].
Go on to the end.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>with an effort</i>]. He was going to East
Africa. He was to sail next day, and I was going with
him. We were going up by the late train to be
married in the morning, and we meant to leave the
car at the station with a letter to his parents&mdash;and
then the car broke down by the roadside&mdash;and you
came, and the next day he sailed&hellip;. Now you
know it all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Yes, that sounds like the truth at last.
I know that I have dragged the truth from you bit by
bit. My God! I was far enough from it that night
when I thought I was protecting an innocent little girl
who was being bullied by her employer. You called
me simple just now&mdash;I was simple indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Yes, you were simple and trusting and
wonderful&mdash;you say you would have married me all
the same if I had dared to tell you. I know you would.
It would have been like you&mdash;like your greatness and
goodness. But, oh, how could I tell you&mdash;how could
I! Oh, Will, you say you could have forgiven me
then&mdash;can't you forgive me now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Forgiveness! What does forgiveness
matter, if there's no belief when trust has gone?
Rachel, I believed in you as I believe in my Redeemer.
You knew I did. What was in your thoughts, this very
evening was it, or was it another lifetime? when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
told you how I trusted and reverenced you? Did you
feel nothing but mockery at the success of your deceit?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> No, no. I thought when you were telling
me, what a great pure heart you had, how I would
try to be worthy of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret</span> [<i>with a bitter laugh</i>]. Worthy of me!
by letting me believe every day of our lives something
that was false, false; something that had never
been. Oh, I can't bear it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel</span> [<i>suddenly with a wild impulse</i>]. Oh,
don't let Mary know!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> Don't speak her name. I can't
endure it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rachel.</span> Don't let her suffer! Oh, don't let
suffering come to her, let me have it all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Carteret.</span> <i>You</i> have it all? Is that what you
think? Suffering is round us all everywhere like the
darkness.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>He sits on sofa, covering his face with his hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> There now, I think everything's ready.
There's one strap more somewhere [<i>looking round</i>]. I
must have left it in the house. And then I shall have
to say good-bye. How can I thank you, Mr Thwaite,
for all you have done for me! [<span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span>, <i>unsmiling,
smokes on in silence</i>]. The way you took me in when
you found me dying and let me stay under your roof
all these weeks&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>gruffly</i>]. That's all right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> You have been endlessly good to me.
I shall never forget it, never.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Never's a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But I mean it, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Oh, yes, I daresay, you mean it&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Good Lord! What an escape! I can't
think how it was I didn't die, when my horse pitched
me off on to my head and left me senseless. I should
have died if you hadn't found me, and no one would
have been the wiser.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> There's plenty dies over here and no
one the wiser.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> There's plenty of others that's alive.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I wonder you troubled to keep another
in the world then, Mr Thwaite.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> It was the gal. She would have it we
ought to pick you up, but I was in a hurry with some
sheep in the cart going to Banooga.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And they mattered more, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Well, they was alive, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> To be sure&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> And you didn't seem to be. But the
gal, she thought you were. So I said, 'Well, if there's
room for him and the sheep too, I'll take him along&mdash;But
what'll we do with him next?' 'Well,' she says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
'I'll look after him.' And I says, 'You've your work
to do, remember.' You can understand, Mr Merton,
that if a man has a sheep farm in this country, that's
his job. His sheep must come first. You don't want
no dead men along.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, I quite see that. And no live ones
either if they are in the way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> That's about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I must have been most awfully inconvenient.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Well, it was just the lambing time,
and Kirstin had to look after the ewes. Lucky it
were a healthy season.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. And she managed to look
after me as well as the ewes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> She knows she's got to get her work
done.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> She seems able to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> She knows her job. I've kept her at
it since she was a little wench.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> It's wonderful, all she can do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. Wonderful? What's
there wonderful in it, a strong, healthy gal like that?
I'd be ashamed if she didn't know what a farmer's
daughter's got to know&mdash;about dipping the sheep,
washing 'em, and shearing, and breaking a horse, and
riding him bareback round the boundary. She'd need
to be ashamed if she couldn't. And she can use her
eyes and her ears. There's nothing she can't see or
hear, that gal. Oh, any woman can learn to work if
you just make her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Any woman?&hellip; that kind of
work? [<i>smiling and shaking his head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> I daresay women isn't much use where
you come from.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I come from London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>with a pitying smile</i>]. London &hellip;
ah!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I shall think of your life out here, Mr
Thwaite, when I'm back in London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> No, no, you won't, young man.
Nothing of the kind. You won't be thinking of us, no
more than we shall be thinking of you. I shall be
thinking of my sheep, and you&mdash;well, whatever folks
do think of in London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> A good many things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>indifferently and rather incredulously</i>].
Do they?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I shall have to think a great deal about
my job. I'm going to be a doctor, and it's uphill work
at first. But my uncle is a successful doctor, and that
will be a help.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Ah, you mean he's done the work for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Some of it perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> I've not much use for doctors. Never
had one inside my door.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> They seem to be needed in London,
luckily for me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Never been there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But you are an Englishman, aren't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>sombrely</i>]. Yes, I'm an Englishman.
My father was a Yorkshire farmer; my mother was a
Scotch woman. I quarrelled with him and ran away
from home and I went to Liverpool. And the captain
of a steamer going to Sydney took me on as cabin boy,
and on board there was an Australian sheep farmer.
And he brought me to his sheep run&mdash;and afterwards
I married his daughter, and he died, and I went on
with the sheep farming. That's my tale.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And you never saw your parents again?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> I never went back. I never knew my
mother. She died when I was born. Kirstin, she
never knew her mother neither.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> That's a bad loss.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>smokes reflectively</i>]. Mebbe, mebbe.
But she's no need of a mother. I've learned her what
she'd need to know, and though I says it, she's been
brought up by an honest man to earn an honest living
in honest ways. And that's enough for anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> It's a great deal. But is it enough for
her? Doesn't she want any more?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> I don't know&mdash;but if she did, want 'd
be her master. [<i>Passes his hand along the railing</i>].
There's that fence going again. I believe the wood's
rotting. Kirstin! [<span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> <i>comes out of the house
with a strap in her hand</i>]. Look at this place in the
fence&mdash;it's rotting. That's bad.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>looking at it</i>]. Yes, I know. There's
some more going the same way, further up.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> Well, you'd better go round and see
where the places are; it'll have to be looked to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, father; I'll see to it.</p>

<p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> <i>goes on looking at the fence and passing
his hand along it</i>. <span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> <i>gives the strap to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Merton</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Here's a strap you left in the house,
Mr Merton.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, thank you so much. [<i>Tries to
put strap round bag</i>]. I'm afraid it's about time for
me to be off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, I suppose it is. I've saddled your
mare for you; she's ready.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Have you done that besides everything
else? I'm not going to try to thank you for it all&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> No, I wouldn't. If the mare is saddled,

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>looking at him struggling with the

[<i>Taking the strap and pulling out a knife</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>looking impatiently at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span>].
Well, I'll be stepping, Mr Merton. I'm rather busy
to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. I'm so sorry, Mr Thwaite&mdash;this
is the last time I shall interrupt the farm work.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>repeats half to herself</i>]. The last time&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> I'll be going on. Kirstin, you follow
me down there away&mdash;when you're ready [<i>rather
sarcastically</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, father. [<i>Still doing strap</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>shaking hands with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span>]. Good-bye,
then, Mr Thwaite. And<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>interrupting him</i>]. Now don't start

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> You must let me thank you, Kirstin.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>looking up at him and smiling</i>]. Must

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And then I shall have to say good-bye

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>forcing herself to be calm</i>]. Yes, it's
good-byes, to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> It's no use saying it over and over
again, but I do want you to believe how grateful I am
to you for saving my life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You needn't to thank me. I was glad I
did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>half to himself, looking round</i>]. It's
so queer when you're leaving a place. It looks different,
somehow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Does it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Don't you know what I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> No, I've never left a place. I've always
been here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Isn't it extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Why, to find you and your father here
miles away from anyone, leading this life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Why is it extraordinary? We've always
done it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> That's just it. You've never done
anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And you do the same thing day after
day.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> The same thing? No. There's the
feeding to look after in the winter, and the lambing
in the spring, and the shearing in the summer&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, the summer in January.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> January&mdash;when else should it be?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Our summer's in July.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>interested</i>]. Is it? I didn't know that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Didn't you, Kirstin? And our spring
is in March and April.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> March and April? Those are our
beautiful autumn months. Oh, how odd. When do
your lambs come, then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> In February and March.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh, how strange!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Kirstin, did you never go to school?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> To school? No, how could I? Father
couldn't have spared me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Not even when you were little?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> I don't believe anyhow there was a
school near enough. Father learned me to read, and
I write a bit too, but not very well. [<i>Smiling</i>]. I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
always worked with the sheep ever since I can remember.
When I was little I used to drive them in and
see if any were missing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Could you count them?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Oh, no; but I knew them
all one from another and could tell which was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Could you? Can you do that now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Well, of course. Anyone could.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Anyone? Do you really believe that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, anyone living out here, like us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Ah, you know things we don't know
in London.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Do I? But then [<i>quite simply as
though asking the question</i>] perhaps you know things
in London that we don't know out here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Perhaps we do&hellip;. I
shall think of you when I'm back in my London home.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">[<i>All through this scene</i> <span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> <i>is not in the least

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Shall you? I'm glad of that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And wonder what you're doing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You needn't to wonder that&mdash;I've told
you what we'll be doing all the year round.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And is it enough for you, Kirstin?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Enough! It fills up all the time, I can
tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Are you content?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Content? I've never thought about it.
Oh, yes, I suppose I am. I've always been content up
to now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>cheerfully</i>]. Then there's no reason
why you should leave off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Daresay not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But when you read stories about other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
kinds of lives, doesn't it make you want to see something
else?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> I'm not much of a reader. Father has
some books put away but I don't care about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Doesn't he ever read a newspaper
even?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> There's none comes here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Well, I didn't think such
people existed. This place will seem a dream to me
when I get back.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> A dream, will it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, you and your life here, and looking
out and seeing wide pastures, and the palm trees,
and the eucalyptus instead of seeing plane trees dropping
their leaves on the London pavements. Oh! to
see a wet plane leaf shining in the lights of London!
There's no place like it after all. And now I'm going
back to it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You like London best then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Well, all Londoners do. I'm a
Londoner, you see&mdash;I was born and bred there, just
as you were born and bred here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Of course, yes. Mr Merton, you
said you'd think of us when you was away. I'd like
to think of you too, and what you was doing in London,
if you could tell me what it's like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Well, it's rather difficult to
tell you&mdash;it's all so very different. For one thing,
when I look out of my window in London, I see the
wall of somebody else's house, instead of a wide expanse
like this.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh, is there a house as near as that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> A house? Dozens.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Dozens of houses close to yours?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Scores! Hundreds! Thousands! of
houses wherever you go, wherever you look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh, is that really true?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Of course it is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> But how do you know them apart?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> They have numbers on them&mdash;a number
painted on every house.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh! painted on every house&mdash;like a
brand! It must be very difficult to count up to so
many thousands.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, no; they begin at <i>one</i> again in
each street.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> How many houses are there in a street?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> That depends. Sometimes there are
fifty, sometimes two hundred and more. My house is
147.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> 147. I shall remember that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But the number won't be enough. You
must remember the street too. The street I live in
is called Devonshire Street&mdash;so that if you want to
know where to find me, it's 147 Devonshire Street.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> 147 Devonshire Street&mdash;I shall remember
that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I'll write it down for you [<i>takes out
his pocket-book, tears out a sheet and writes on it</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Write it very clear, won't you, so as I
can read it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, I'll write it very clear. There
now, you can't mistake it&mdash;Henry Merton, 147
Devonshire Street, London. So when you come to
London, Kirstin, don't forget. Look, I shall write
that down too&mdash;to remind you! [<i>writing</i>] <i>Come to
London, Kirstin, don't forget.</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>looking at it</i>]. Yes, that's very clear.
I can read that. [<i>Reads</i>] 'Henry Merton, 147
Devonshire Street. Come to London, Kirstin, don't
forget.' I shan't forget, but I shan't come to
London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Who knows? Perhaps by the time
you come, I shall have got on in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> What does that mean?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, Kirstin, you are too delightful!
It means &hellip; well &hellip; it means&mdash;it's rather
difficult to explain.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Does it mean being better than other
people?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Um&mdash;not altogether! Something of
the kind perhaps. It means getting on in the thing
you're doing. I'm going to try to be a successful
doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Does a successful doctor cure everybody?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Not always. But a great many people
come to him to be cured and give him money whether
he cures them or not.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Do they? Then you'll have a great
deal of money.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I hope so&mdash;I want it most dreadfully.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. Do you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I have hardly any&mdash;that's one of my
difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> What a pity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, well, it'll come all right, I daresay,
when I'm back in London and can start work.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>looking at paper</i>]. When you're back
at 147 Devonshire Street&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite.</span> She won't find that very useful, I expect.

and see you off.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Thank you very much.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thwaite</span> [<i>exasperated</i>]. Ah!</p>

<p class="noindent">[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant</span>]. [<i>She stands waiting</i>].</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh, Mrs Plant. I want to speak to
you about one or two things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Yes, sir? [<i>she waits</i>]. It wasn't
about the soup being cold, sir? For it was, there's
no denying it. But then you <i>did</i> keep your dinner
waiting to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, the soup was cold as a matter of
fact&mdash;and I did keep dinner waiting&mdash;but that's not
what I have to say.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> It does seem too much really for
you to come in so late, sir, and then have to go out
again after dinner. Your uncle, Dr. John, he never
liked doing that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I don't like it either. But that's what
a doctor's life is like&mdash;to be sent for at all sorts of
hours. It would be worse, you know, if I were never
sent for at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Yes, sir; but it would be less trouble
for you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And less money. I could hardly keep
up this house if I had no patients.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> No, sir. Oh, I quite see that you
have to put up with them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I rang for you to say first that I shall
be going into Surrey to-morrow for the day probably.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>evidently hesitating</i>]. And next week
I'm going to Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Are you, sir? You don't often go
away so early in the year.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> I am going to stay at Castle Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant</span> [<i>impressed</i>]. Indeed, sir&mdash;with the
Countess? Oh! <i>indeed</i>. You would see a letter that
the Countess sent round by hand just after you went
out.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, I've seen it. It's about the
journey. It's rather a difficult place to get to, it
seems.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Indeed, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And I also wanted to say to you that I
am thinking of making a change in my arrangements&mdash;[<i>he
hesitates</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> A change, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>hesitates</i>]. I was going to tell you&mdash;the
fact is I am thinking of marrying.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Marrying, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> No reason at all, sir&mdash;on the contrary&mdash;but
I thought perhaps you was too comfortable
to marry, so to speak. Of course, Dr John, he always
said he thought it better for doctors to marry, though
he didn't carry it out himself, as it were.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>rather impatiently</i>]. Well, it's my
marrying I'm talking about&mdash;and I'll tell you when I
come back from Scotland who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Thank you, sir. The Countess's
daughter is a very nice young lady, isn't she&mdash;Lady
Betty?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>looking at her with a smile</i>]. Very.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Of course, sir, her ladyship&mdash;I mean
the lady you are going to marry&mdash;will want to make
changes in the household?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Of course. But we needn't discuss
that now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> No, sir. To tell the truth, sir, I
shouldn't be sorry to have another maid instead of
Jane. Jane's so excitable at times&mdash;she's quite a
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Pray, Mrs Plant [<i>stopping her</i>] I cannot
discuss that now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Plant.</span> Just as you like, sir. Dr John, he
always liked to look forward, as it were.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes&mdash;I did.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> And I never thought I'd come. But
now I have. I can hardly believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> It is unbelievable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> My father died five years ago, and I
was left alone and I've run the farm ever since. Then
I thought I'd come.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But how did you get here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> It <i>was</i> a business. I rode sixty miles
from Banooga to the railroad, and then I got into the
train and went to Brisbane and then on to a ship to
London. Oh, we was such a long time on the sea.
And then after I got off the ship in the river I asked
the way here and I walked.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, it took me a good bit of time. I
believe I've been wandering round and round. There's
so many people and things everywhere that I was sort
of mazed. At home I'd know my way by the stars
[<i>she smiles</i>] but here they don't seem no use to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> And you had those things to carry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh, that's nothing. I'm strong, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Well, now you must sit down. You
must be very tired. [<i>She is going to sit on a small
chair</i>]. No. [<i>He motions her to an armchair</i>]. That's
more comfortable. [<i>He draws forward the armchair</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Oh, I don't mind for that&mdash;I'm used
to a wooden settle at home, you remember.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Yes, I remember. [<i>With a sudden
thought</i>]. When did you have anything to eat?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Just before I left the ship, about two
o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Good heavens, you must be starving.
[<i>Puts out his hand to the bell, then pauses</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. Not as bad as that. I'm
used to being out for long stretches.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> You shall have something at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Thank you. I won't say no. Oh, I'm

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Kirstin, where are you &hellip; [<i>stops</i>&mdash;<i>hesitates</i>].

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> I thought I'd live here with you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Oh&mdash;yes&hellip;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You see, I have no one to please but
myself now that father's gone. He died five years
ago, and I worked hard ever since and made money,
and saved up. I sold my sheep, and when you was
with us you told me you weren't rich, and wanted
more money, so I thought I'd come to London and
bring you some.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>staggered</i>]. Bring <i>me</i>&mdash;some?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, I've brought you &pound;10,000.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> &pound;10,000!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Yes, it's in here [<i>lifting bundle from
round her neck and putting it on table</i>]&mdash;all in &pound;10
notes. I tied them up in bundles myself. And I've
never left it off me till this minute, night or day. A
rough fellow nearly got it away from me on the road
to the railway, but I soon sent him about his business.
[<i>Taps her pocket and shows end of revolver</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton</span> [<i>gasps</i>&mdash;<i>tries to recover himself</i>]. It's
very good of you, Kirstin, to bring it to me, but&mdash;but&mdash;I
can't take that money, you know. I really
can't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You can't take it! But you must&mdash;it's
for you&mdash;that's why I worked for it all the time&mdash;for
you to have it and be rich. I've got plenty for
myself. <i>I</i> don't want it&mdash;I've got a lot sewn into my
belt.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> But it's impossible! Don't you understand?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> Impossible? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Things are different here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> But people like having money, don't
they?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Of course they do&mdash;but I can't take <i>that</i>.
But I'll explain it to you in the morning. Now [<i>passing
his hand over his forehead</i>] I'm&mdash;you're&mdash;too tired.
I'll tell my housekeeper to take you up to a bedroom
and give you something to eat. [<i>Rings</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>after he has rung</i>]. Can't you explain
now? I'm not tired really. I'm never tired, and
nothing matters now that I've got here. Oh, I was

<p><span class="smallcaps">Betty.</span> Dear mother, you needn't be.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch.</span> I wonder if we know him well
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Betty.</span> Surely we saw enough of him during

all, since he saved my sister's life I ought to be grateful
to him, and perhaps something more. [<i>Smiling</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch.</span> Yes, I suppose he did save her

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch.</span> Because I do feel that by asking

definitely asked the question!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch.</span> I think he has been afraid of
what the answer would be.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch</span> [<i>with a smile and a sigh</i>]. Well,
no one will be able to say it's a brilliant marriage, or a
worldly marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Betty.</span> I'm not a worldly person. Nor is he,

<p><span class="smallcaps">Lady Gairloch.</span> I wonder what your father

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin.</span> You needn't to send me away again.
I'm going off myself. But first I want to tell you that
I've heard what you was saying. I didn't know where
to go as your housekeeper was upstairs&mdash;and so I just
waited in the passage and I couldn't help hearing what
you said. I have terrible good ears, as you know, and
I heard you tell these two ladies that I'm not in my

you'd be like this and that you would be&mdash;oh! <i>horrified</i>
when I came! Oh, if I could forget <i>that</i>! I
almost can't believe it now. It's so dreadful&mdash;because
I had believed something so different&mdash;when you was
over there with us. I thought there could be no one
else like you. I'd never seen such a fine gentleman
before, and I thought there was no one else so clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
or so good or so handsome. Though father he was always
saying you was just like other folk, neither
better nor worse. Oh, all those years that I've lived
for you and thought you'd be glad when I came.
When my father died and I was left, the first thing I
thought was 'At last! Now I can go. Some day I'll
go to him.' And you had told me you were poor and
hadn't enough money and wanted more&mdash;and I made
up my mind I'd bring you some. And I worked day
after day&mdash;I worked that hard, to make money for
you&mdash;and I made it, and I saved it, and when I had
sold my sheep and got enough, I brought it to you
and every day and every hour of that fearful long
journey I've thought of when I should get here, and
how strange it would be&mdash;and I should be rather
frightened. But then I thought you'd be so glad to
see me, and so glad I had brought you so much money.
And then I got here &hellip; and you weren't so very
glad. I knew that last night. But I didn't know you
were horrified. And you wouldn't take the money I
had worked so hard to get. And you say I've spoilt
everything&mdash;and it's all been for nothing, all these
years&mdash;worse than nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> Kirstin! What can I say &hellip; I

<p><span class="smallcaps">Kirstin</span> [<i>stopping him</i>]. You needn't to say no

<p><span class="smallcaps">Merton.</span> No, no&mdash;you can't go away like that&mdash;I

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> My dear child, what is the
matter? You never seem able to settle to anything
now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> The truth is, mamma, I'm bored.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Bored, when after our long
separation during the war you've come home to live
with your mother?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> That's just it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> What's just it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> I've come home to live with my mother.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Mary! Do you mean to say
you don't like it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, how dreadful this is! Oh,
the girls of the present age!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> That's what you're always saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mamma, but I can't help being of the present day,
can I? I'd cheerfully be of another time if I could.
[<i>Going to window</i>]. Nothing ever happens here&mdash;nothing
exciting, and I, who have been a V.A.D. in
France during the war, and have conveyed wounded
officers by myself to hospitals at midnight [<span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland</span>
<i>holds up her hands in horror</i>] look out of the
window for months and see nothing at all. [<i>Goes
aimlessly to window&mdash;gives a cry</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Something is happening at last! Look,
look, something is coming down from the sky. Oh,
what can it be? Yes, it's a parachute and a man
hanging to it. He'll come down in the garden; I
must render first aid quick.</p>

<div class="center">

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland</span> [<i>agitated, goes to window, looks

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, Mary, is he dead?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>speaking very feebly</i>]. No, no, I
think not&mdash;thank you very much.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> He is suffering from shock. [<i>In a business-like
tone</i>]. Lie down, warmth, and quiet&mdash;cover
extremities.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>feebly</i>]. Yes, quite right&mdash;keep me
warm and quiet and cover my extremities.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Now you are not to talk.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Very well, I won't. But I must tell
you in case you should ask me&mdash;I remember nothing
before it happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Of course, that's very customary with an
accident.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>emphatically</i>]. It's more than that&mdash;I'm
so anxious there should be no mistake about it&mdash;I've
quite lost my memory. I've forgotten who I am&mdash;clean
forgotten&mdash;it's no use your asking me, it would
only excite me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> No, we won't, of course, my
dear young man.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I like being called young man. It's
a compliment when one's turned forty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>alert</i>]. Oh, you do know that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. No, I don't. What did I
say?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> You said you were turned forty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> No, no, I couldn't have said that if
I don't know who I am. I have no idea.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> It's too sad, really. The poor
fellow! He may have a wife and family, and we can't
tell them he is here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> No, no, you can't. I should be sure
to remember my wife if I had one. Don't tell me
about it&mdash;it will excite me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Mother, he really must be kept quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, dear, it's all so mysterious
and disquieting, Mary. I shall go round to the
Rectory and tell the Canon about it. He is so wise.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>anxious to get her away</i>]. Yes, do,
mamma. I'm sure that will be the best thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland</span> [<i>going out</i>]. I shall be back in a
minute. I shan't put on my hat. I'll just take my
parasol to look respectable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Where is she going?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> To the Rectory. It is just across the
green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> That sounds very soothing&mdash;a Rectory
across the green.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Yes. Now don't talk any more; try to
be quite quiet. Are you comfortable?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Immensely.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Now close your eyes and I daresay you
will go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Yes, that's what I always do when
I go to sleep&mdash;I close my eyes first.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>humouring him</i>]. Of course; then do it
now.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>jumping up with a shriek</i>]. Ah, ha!
you there! You standing there!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> What is it? Why are you speaking so
loud?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> You don't think I'm mad? Don't
you mind being left alone with someone who has
dropped from the sky and has lost his memory?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Not in the least. I dealt with many
worse things during the war.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Admirable one! Have you a good
head, a ready brain, a resourceful mind?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Yes, I have all those.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I'll tell you what I want&mdash;I need a
confederate.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Oh, this time you think I'm mad,
don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Well, something like it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Not in the least. I'm as sane as you
are. Listen, I must have a confederate to get me out
of this hole.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> What hole?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Why, my disappearing from my
home, jumping from an aeroplane, and tumbling into
your garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Your home! But I thought you had
forgotten it!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Not lost your memory?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Of course not. That was only to put
you off the scent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Off the scent?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Yes, yes, yes. Now look here, my
dear young lady&mdash;can I trust you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>speaking very calmly</i>]. Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Very well then&mdash;this is my sad story.
I'm tired of life&mdash;I'm tired of the world and of all the
things that are happening in it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> And you wish to commit suicide? Yes,
that is a very common symptom.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Not at all! On the contrary. I
don't mean to take my own life&mdash;that is, I want to
take it for my own and nobody else's. And my wife
will insist on my sharing hers. It's a perfect mania with
her, and I can't bear it any longer and I mean to disappear.
She has opinions about everything in creation,
and I have none!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> None? That must be very dull.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Dull? If I were left to myself I
shouldn't be dull for a moment. I have two cherished
pursuits&mdash;golf and music. I play golf and I play the
'cello. And that would be enough for me. I don't
want to know about the things they talk about in
the papers. My wife does. She went to College, and
a woman always comes away from the 'Varsity with
her head chock full of ideas&mdash;I never knew one who
didn't&mdash;it's something awful. And my wife has views
about every blessed thing that's mentioned in the
papers, and she will talk to me about them all. I can't
stand it any longer. I don't want to hear about
Politics or Commerce or New Art or Advanced Science,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
or the rates or the taxes or the Axes or inflammation
of the lung or inflation of the currency or the Moplahs
or the blacks or the whites or the browns, or the East
and the West, and the Tigris, and the Thames, and
Ireland, and Mesopotamia, and the Dublin Parliament
whose name I can't pronounce, and the London Parliament
whose doings I can't follow, and Bridge, and
the film, and the censors, and the traffic, and the
Czecho-Slovaks, and the Japanese, and the Murmanskis,
and Bolsheviskis, and the Colonies, and the bank
rate, and deferred shares, and preferred shares, and
committees, and conferences, and Coalitions, or France,
or Belgium, or Italy, or America, and the Colonies,
and the Dominion, and Australia, and housing questions,
and the servant problem, and the League of
Nations, and amalgamations, or reparations, or war
babies, or adoption, or the Church, or the stage, or
the Cubists, or the psycho-analysts, or the unemployed,
and the doles, and the Poles, the South Pole,
or the North Pole, or the Polish Poles, or the telephone,
or the penny postage, and the trams, and the
strikes, and the weather, and prize-fighting, and the
football matches. She has views on 'em all! And
she tries to make me share them by suggestion. Can
you wonder that I fly?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Oh, is that why you came by aeroplane?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> No, no, you mistake. I use the word
fly in a metaphorical sense. I mean, can you wonder
that I keep trying to escape?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Oh, you have done it before?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I have tried four times. The first
time by train, the next by steamer, the third by car,
the fourth on foot, and every time that too devoted
woman has got me back. The moment I disappear
she circulates a description of me and I'm found at
once. It's up in all the police offices. 'A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
man of good appearance, looking between 35 and 40,
of middle height, pleasant and genial countenance.
Probably suffering from loss of memory; answers to
the name of Tom.' You see that's enough to identify
me at once.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Then do you suffer from loss of memory?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Of course I don't. But when I'm
found I have to say something, so I pretend I don't
know who I am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> And what happens next?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>groaning</i>]. Well, then she tries bringing
my memory back by suggestion! And when I
can't bear that any longer, I pretend I've got it back.
And now this last&mdash;the fifth&mdash;time I've tried a new
way. I've come by aeroplane and jumped out.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> That ought to cover up your tracks.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Yes, I'll tell you what I did. I have
a pal who is mad on flying and who was going to do
a stunt in Norfolk, somewhere near King's Lynn, so
I went to Paddington and took a ticket for a small
station due west of London to put them off the scent&mdash;a
place I saw in Bradshaw called Camperton.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Camperton! Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Never heard of it before. We
went off north-east&mdash;at least I hope we did, but
I believe the fellow lost his way or something went
wrong. He was turning round and round and his
confounded things made such a row I couldn't make
him hear, so I thought I'd chance it and I jumped
out. I have practised jumping with his parachute
several times before. And now I haven't an idea
where I am, but a good bit north-east of London, I
hope.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Wretched man, you are five miles from
Camperton.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Good heavens! Then I'm undone!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
She'll come down in the car and find me as sure as
I'm alive. Oh, my dear girl, what am I to do? You'll
help me, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Of course I will. She'll never think of
looking for you here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Won't she!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>looking from window</i>]. Oh, there's my
mother! and the Rector coming. Quick, quick, lie
down again.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">[<span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> <i>lies down and is covered</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Who is the Rector?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Canon Hartley.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Hartley&mdash;not Bob Hartley?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Yes, his name is Robert.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Good Lord! He was with me at
Oxford. We used to make music together, and he
used to pretend I played out of tune. Good gracious,
what are we to do?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> You be quiet, and remember you have
lost your memory, and I'll play up. I'm a great
authority on shocks and accidents.</p>

He may be quite unconscious that he is

It is most important to do everything we possibly can

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Music? No.</p>

Do you remember that charmer in pink? Who got a
First, by Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> A First! [<i>Groans</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> Remember that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Remember what?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> The girl at Somerville.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span> [<i>blankly</i>]. I don't know. The girl
where?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> At Somerville, dear friend, at Somerville.
[<i>To the others</i>]. It needs an infinite patience
and kindness to deal with these sad cases. At Somerville,
the ladies' college, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> And yet at that time you seemed interested
in her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I tell you I don't remember. I remember
nothing! I've lost my memory and I've lost
my senses, and I don't know who I am or how I
came here or anything. And I don't know who you
are and why you're going on talking.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> Quite so, quite so, don't excite yourself,
pray.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> It's you who are exciting me with all
this chattering and wanting me to remember this and
remember that. You're doing me a great deal of
harm, and I tell you what, if I don't know anything
that happened in the past I do know what's going to
happen in the future, and that is that I shall punch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
your head in a minute if you ask me any more questions&mdash;so
now! [<i>Behaves as if he were mad</i>].</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">[<i>He jumps up</i>].</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector</span> [<i>retreating</i>]. Oh, pray, dear sir, keep
calm. [<i>Trying to smile</i>]. No need for you to punch
my head or any one else's.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I'm not so sure.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector</span> [<i>to the others</i>]. What a sad condition to
find him in. But there isn't a doubt that he's Welburn.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> What's that you're saying&mdash;that I'm
Welburn? What's that? Don't call me names.
You take care not to say it again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> My dear sir, I won't say it if you don't
like it. I'll leave you to rest a little longer, and I will
call again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> No, don't you call again, please.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> Dear sir, don't be agitated.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Now you lie down again, and you shall
not be disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Thank you very much. [<i>Lies down</i>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>

head and groans</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, Rector, what do you think
about it? I do depend on your advice.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> My dear lady, you are positively
trembling. These harrowing scenes are not good for
you. Come out into the air for a few minutes. Walk
across the green with me to the Rectory; the air will
do you good.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. Yes, I think I will.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>]. We are within call if you want us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>ironically</i>]. Thank you, mamma. [<span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> The old fool badgering me about Oxford!
That was an inspiration, wasn't it, pretending
to be mad. How was it? Was that all right?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Upon my word, I feel almost mad in
reality when I think of his saying that I played out
of tune, and raking up the Somerville girls, and all
that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Had you really forgotten the charmer in
pink?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Forgotten her! [<i>Groans</i>]. How
could I? I married her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> What! Was she&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> My wife? Of course she was&mdash;of
course she <i>is</i>&mdash;that's the point I mind most.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> She must be very clever if she took a
First.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> That's just it. She is&mdash;that's the
awful part. Now I'm not clever, you know. I didn't
take a First. She knows that, so she thinks she has
a better head than I have, and upon my soul, I don't
know what to do about it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> About your head?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> No, hers&mdash;I mean about hers and
mine together. That's the mistake&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> But you're trying to remedy it, by separating
then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Yes, but I have never succeeded.
That's where the brains come in, you see. Each time
I try to get away and hide from her, she gets me back
again. Oh! if only I can pull it off this time.</p>

It's all right&mdash;they're still talking at the Rectory gate.
They're both wondering evidently what to do next.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I say, it's really awfully funny, isn't
it?</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent">[<i>They both laugh</i>].

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> I must say it is. But it'll take some
doing, you know. What is your plan?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> A very simple one. I shall be left
some time with you to look after me, and when that
happens you will avert your eyes for a moment, and
I shall open the door and walk out. That's always
the best thing to do when you're shut up anywhere
if it can be managed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> If! Yes! But I'm game to do anything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Look here, you really are one of the

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Well, really, I'm awfully grateful to you
for having brought excitement into our lives.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Oh, they are coming back this way.
Then I must subside again. [<i>Jumps on to couch.</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> A lady! [<i>Gets under the rug</i>].</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Mary, I want the large scale
map. This lady is asking the way to Camperton.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Thank you very much. [<i>She is
tall and masculine looking, and speaks in a deep voice</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn</span> [<i>looking at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Welburn</span>]. You have
an invalid here?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Yes, this poor gentleman fell
from an aeroplane into our garden&mdash;at least he jumped
from a parachute. He might have been killed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> How much is he hurt?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> I don't think he is very much
hurt, but he is suffering from shock and loss of
memory, and ought to be kept absolutely quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Loss of memory, indeed? I have
a good deal of experience in dealing with loss of
memory, as a near relation of mine frequently suffers
from it. But I find that it always yields to suggestion.
Have you tried that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> We have not. From the patient's condition
it was evidently most essential that he should
be kept quiet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Suggestion would do him no
harm. You can suggest to a patient that he should
be calm, and he becomes calm&mdash;and then after that it
is very rare that loss of memory does not yield
to further treatment&mdash;at least that is my experience.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> I believe it would be a good thing to
try suggestion in this case.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Ah! You believe in it too? I
am glad to hear this from one of your cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> I don't know that I do in every case.
But this one has special interest for me, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
anxious to try everything, as I know this man, although
he has not so far recognised me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> He doesn't remember who he is himself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Quite a common symptom. But
it is an extremely important factor in the case that
you recognise him. Are you quite certain?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> Absolutely. We were at Oxford
together&mdash;his name is Welburn.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. His name is Welburn?
So is mine!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">All.</span> Yours!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn</span> [<i>advancing to couch and uncovering</i>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Yes, that's the way he groans
in his sleep when he has one of these attacks. He has
had four of them&mdash;and he wanders away from home
unconscious of his actions.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, how sad!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> But he always recovers.
Thomas! [<i>Shakes him</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary.</span> Oh, I'm afraid you will do him harm.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Young lady, I am much obliged
to you for your kind care of my husband, but now
you had better leave him to me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> Quite so. [<i>He and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland</span> <i>nod

At least I can't remember. [<i>As though trying to collect
his thoughts</i>].<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Oh, you will remember presently.
You'll get your memory back all right. Now
look at me. Look straight into my eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> I don't like looking at you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> He has these delusions at times,
but they pass off. I will take him away with me in
the car, at once, back to his home. Come, Thomas.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Welburn.</span> Where do you want me to go? [<i>To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Mary</span>, <i>with a forlorn hope</i>]. Can't you help me? I
don't like going away with this stranger.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mary</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn</span>]. Do you mind my
saying that we have no proof that this is your
husband?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Maitland.</span> Oh, my dear Mary, it is so
evident!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> No&mdash;now that was a sensible remark
for a girl. Girls are generally foolish. You shall
have proof. I can tell you what the motto and crest
are on that signet ring he wears: the motto is <i>Semper
Volans</i> and the crest is a swallow. Though a goose
would have been more appropriate. [<i>Takes his hand</i>].
There you may see for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Rector.</span> So it is. Oh, my dear madam, we have
every confidence in you, and we have only to congratulate
you and your husband on being brought together
by such a wonderful chance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Welburn.</span> Thank you very much. Come

days.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Do you live in London?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Well&mdash;I live in Brixton.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Brixton, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Yes, we call it London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, do you? It's quite a nice name for
it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Yes, it sounds well. And which of your
palaces are you living in at this moment?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Only in Grosvenor Square. I'm going to
sell Castle Peckham.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Are you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> What a pity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> That's not the worst misfortune&mdash;I
haven't a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Has anybody?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Very few, I believe&mdash;what <i>I</i> call a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Are you flying from London, then?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I'm going to look for one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Well done! At Brixton?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> No, further away&mdash;she's at Penge.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Funny place to look for a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> You'll know when you get there.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> The person I'm really looking for is her
employer. She has a little country retreat outside
Penge, made of five workmen's cottages knocked into
one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom</span> [<i>disapprovingly</i>]. Five!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Yes, I suppose there were no more to be
had.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Very probable. Who is the employer?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> The Princess Blakowska.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> A Princess! That promises well for the
cook.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Yes, I've been up to London, to try to
find her in Berkeley Square. She was out. Now I'm
going to see if she's at Penge. We've exchanged
letters already&mdash;we've had a wonderful correspondence,
even though it began on what is generally considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
an unromantic subject. She came across my
life at a time when it was overshadowed by misfortune;
my French chef had just left me to go to
America.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> To be sure&mdash;he would.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> But she brought light into the gloom. I
took up the <i>Times</i> one morning in despair.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Yes, lots of people feel that way when
they take up the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> But that day I found comfort in it. I
scanned the advertisements; then I read, "A Russian
Princess strongly recommends her admirable cook."
Imagine! I wrote to the Princess in words of burning
anxiety. She answered. I wrote again. She replied
by a letter breathing sympathy and comprehension in
every line. Listen. [<i>He draws out letter and reads it</i>].
"The Princess Blakowska presents her compliments
to the Duke of Peckham Rye. She deeply sympathises
with the unfortunate predicament in which he finds
himself, and will indeed be glad to hear that he has
secured the services of an artist like Susan Jennings."
What feeling! What tenderness! How she understands!
Don't you see her? Can you not evoke her?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Tom.</span> Well, I never had your imagination, you
know, Pecky, especially as regards the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>sympathetically</i>]. That you would pant?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Pant! No! I mean that in a
second-class it's impossible to keep one's self <i>to</i> one's
self as one would wish.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh! You find it easier to be exclusive
going third?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Third! I wasn't going third; I
was going first, but I arrived in such a hurry, that I
got into the carriage without stopping to look.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> That is exactly what happened to me,

it. I can tell by my hat. [<i>Pulling her hat straight</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>aside&mdash;looking at him</i>]. Friendly

Do you travel?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Invariably, when I'm in the train.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Ah, but I mean in ribbons and
laces and that sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. No, madam; I generally
travel in tweed unless I am in London, when I wear
a black coat, and generally a black face and hands as
well, especially in the train.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> It is true that the smuts are very
disagreeable. I really have a hard struggle sometimes
to be fit to be seen. [<i>Looking complacently at her

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I must congratulate you, madam, on
your success in the struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> In my position it is so very
essential that I should be well dressed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>amused</i>]. In your position?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>firmly</i>]. Yes, in my position.
Now I'm not going to tell you what it is, so you
needn't think it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> My dear madam, I never dreamt of being
so indiscreet. I only meant that it is evident that
you must shine in society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, I shine all right, no doubt
about that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>gallantly</i>]. I can well imagine it. Have
you been out much in London this season?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, I've hardly had a moment
to myself the whole of the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Indeed! Dinners, balls, parties, I suppose,
every night?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Every night, yes!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> And which do you consider the most tiring
form of entertainment?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, dinners, certainly&mdash;especially
those very long ones.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Ah, I see that like the rest of your sex,
you don't seem to care much about the noble art of
dining.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I assure you, you are very much
mistaken. I flatter myself that if anyone in Europe
understands that art, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, then, how much we have in common!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. You and me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Yes, don't you feel it yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> No, I can't say that I do. I
don't like having much in common with people I meet
in the train.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> One never knows who they are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> That is the beauty of it. I think that
going about unknown is rather enjoyable.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> It's a cheap enjoyment at any

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> You needn't have run after it
in the tunnel.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I really must apologise&mdash;it was my
natural anxiety not to lose what you said.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Come, come, my good man,
none of your cheap compliments. I'd keep those for
third-class passengers if I were you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ticket Collector.</span> Because it's the Company's

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ticket Collector.</span> Dear me, yes! Thirds is

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Well, I've got a first-class ticket.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ticket Collector.</span> No, I'm not going to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
you anything, m'm. It's no look-out of the Company's
if parties choose to worsen themselves; but

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>sarcastically</i>]. Very kind, I'm

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> There'll be something to pay on my

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ticket Collector.</span> Something to pay? I should
rather think there is. Why can't you gents and
ladies sort yourselves properly before you start, instead
of mixing the Company's accounts in this way?
It's sixteen and two-thirds per cent. since just before
the Bank Holiday, added to 50 per cent. in January,
1918. [<i>Does a rapid sum</i>]. That comes to 4&frac12;d. from
Victoria to Penge.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> The railway company must make a good

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ticket Collector</span> [<i>pocketing money</i>]. Well,
sir, if time is money as people say, the Company must
have lost a good deal of it at this station, through you

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> That would have been cruel of you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Now look here, my good friend,
just stick to your travelling and don't make any more
pretty speeches to me; that's the worst of third-class
people, you never know what they will say next.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> But my dear madam, I trust I have not
said anything very startling&mdash;as yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> No, not as yet, but I daresay
you will in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Well&mdash;I might be able to think of something&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Now, you take care what you're
about. I know what travellers are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I should have thought that travelling
made people pleasanter.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Ah! I see you don't understand&mdash;Never

look very bright. I wonder where I put my newspaper.
Oh, there it is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Do you consider the <i>Ladies' Pictorial</i> an

I can enjoy it in peace. [<i>Holding up paper between them</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>half to himself</i>]. I, on the contrary, dread
being left alone with my own thoughts! For I am
haunted, possessed by one idea&mdash;the thought of that
beautiful unknown&mdash;that lovely Russian I am seeking.
[<i>Looking cautiously at his companion</i>]. Don't

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Dear lady, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, such a thing I've found in
this paper.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> What is it? Has the Government gone
out again?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Not it! Something much more
important! Here's a recipe for tomatoes with cream,
which I've been looking for all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>much excited</i>]. Tomatoes! Oh, how
immensely interesting! I am passionately fond of
tomatoes!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> So am I!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I've been longing to find a new way
of cooking them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> So have I! And now I shall
know it!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> So shall I!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Listen! "Cut off the tops, scoop
out the seeds without breaking the outer skin&mdash;put
them into a large stew pan&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>listening intently</i>]. The seeds?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. No, no, man! The
tomatoes! "Put them in a stew pan with a gill of
oil"&mdash;that's the secret of frying, mind you. Oil, not
butter! Frying oil, the very best oil!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, an intelligent woman!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> "Chop up some button mushrooms,
some parsley, some endive, some celery, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
olives, some oysters, some minced ham, and some fat
bacon; fry all together for five minutes, add the yolks
of two eggs and a tablespoonful of the thickest cream;
fill some patties with the mixture, bake for ten minutes
and serve. This makes a delicious dish." I'm sure it
must be! A dish fit for a Duke!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> For a Duke&mdash;it must, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> And to think I should have taken
up the paper accidentally and come upon it all at once!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>with feeling</i>]. Yes, indeed! It was a
rare piece of good fortune. I am glad to see, madam,
that you are interested in cookery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I am, indeed! More than in
anything else.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, how I admire you for it! Now that
is my ideal of what a woman's interest in life should
be. I love to picture her graceful feminine intelligence
playing round such things as&mdash;as&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Tomatoes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Exactly. Tomatoes, or some other
fragrant product of the soil. There is to me something
repulsive in the idea of a woman's mind endeavouring
to grapple with magisterial problems or political research.
No! Let her rather spend hours of patient
investigation amongst her saucepans, endeavouring to
wring from them their secrets.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> It doesn't take me as long as
that, I can tell you, to find out if a saucepan is clean
or dirty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I was thinking of the finer problems of
the saucepan, the delicate combinations which reveal
the true artist. Tell me, dear lady, do you ever go
into your kitchen, and play the part of tutelary genius
of your establishment?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Into my kitchen!!! I should
think so! I'm hardly ever out of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I was sure of it. I picture you flitting
to and fro, presiding over the culinary labours of the
day, surrounded by a bevy of deft and noiseless
maidens&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, as to that, the less we say
about them, the better. Kitchen-maids are a set of
careless, chattering hussies. They break the plates
and burn the vegetables, and then they say their
mothers are ill and they must go away.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. Oh! Are they such good

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, quite enough, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Of course it's the Crystal Palace;
there it is, shining away like anything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Do you consider it beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Beautiful? Never thought about
that, but it's a most wonderful place.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, yes. The concerts you mean, and
the fireworks.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I don't hold much with concerts,
or fireworks either. It's the restaurant I am thinking
of&mdash;the most wonderful restaurant with a chef in it

things&mdash;when I have such exquisite specimens of the

rather nice to-day. I've a particular reason.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>looking at her admiringly</i>]. It must be a
very particular reason that would justify such a hat
as that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Yes, the hat I must admit is
rather a triumph. You'd hardly believe that it's a
last year's hat, would you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Last year's! Never!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> It is though; it's a hat warmed
up again, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>politely</i>]. But not hashed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> No, not hashed, I flatter myself.
All my friends tell me it looks like a hat from Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> So it does!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> The fact is that last year, when
I was in Paris, I saw one just like it and copied it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Ah, that explains everything. Do you
know Paris well?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, yes. I've been a good deal
in Paris. I studied there&mdash;[<i>catching herself up</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Studied! What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, never you mind what; things
a woman ought to know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I didn't know such things could be learnt
in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Ah, that's because you're a John
Bull, my good friend, and haven't seen enough of the
world. You should try to get leave, and travel on the
Continent for a month or so. It opens one's mind
considerably.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Have you been much abroad? Your
mind seems to be particularly open.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Yes. I don't think there is much

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Where else have you been?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, pretty much all over&mdash;to
Germany, to Italy, and to all sorts of foreign watering
places.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>starting</i>]. Foreign watering places? Have
you ever met any Russian Princesses?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Russian Princesses! I should
think so, all over the place. They're as common as
blackberries!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>disconcerted</i>]. As common as blackberries!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, dear, yes! Russian Princesses
of all kinds, good, bad, and indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I wonder to which of those kinds a Princess
belongs that I am interested in?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> What's her name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Princess Blakowska&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, I know her quite well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>thrilled</i>]. You know her?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, yes! And it's that&mdash;and
other things that made it rather difficult&mdash;[<i>she checks
herself</i>]. But in one respect she would be a woman
after your own heart.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I've no doubt she would!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> She has a passion for cookery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I knew it!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> She understands more about dining
than any other woman I ever met.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, what a delightful friend to have!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Yes, she is! She has been a very
good friend to me, I must say, until&mdash;until we parted
company. But why are you so interested in her? Do
you know her?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> No, I don't know her exactly&mdash;but&mdash;from
what I have heard and imagine of her, I should
like to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I daresay you would. Lots of
people feel the same.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> To tell you the truth, I have been making
an attempt to see her to-day, but without success. I
went to her house in Berkeley Square, but now I am
trying elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> But I thought you didn't know
her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. No more I do, but we've
been exchanging letters.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Exchanging letters?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>with a face of rapture</i>]. Yes, yes; I've
had two letters from her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>looking at him with a sudden
thought</i>]. I wonder if you are looking for something,
too?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Something?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>archly</i>]. Something connected
with a situation&mdash;for someone&hellip;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I am, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, I see; that explains everything.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. Explains everything?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Your interest in tomatoes&hellip;.</p>

give you a word of advice. It isn't my business, I

the Princess Blakowska.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>embarrassed</i>]. Try&mdash;for her?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I don't think it's a situation
you'd like.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> A situation I should like!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> At least, I know it's a situation
other people haven't liked.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Other people!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, dear me, yes! She's always
changing!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Always changing!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Always. You know your own
business best, of course, but there's a word to the wise
for you, if you choose to take it. After all, these
things are always a gamble, one never knows how they
will turn out.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>bewildered</i>]. A gamble?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I'm embarked on the same sort
of adventure myself&mdash;I'm going for the Duke of Peckham
Rye.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>bounding from his seat</i>]. What, madam?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I daresay it won't be an
altogether easy job. They say he's a queer customer
sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Queer customer!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Yes, very.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> I wonder what else they say about him!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Oh, they say he's rather a fogey,
of course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> A fogey!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> And very fond of the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>pleased</i>]. Oh, is he?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> And that he can't be five minutes
with one without making himself agreeable to her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Well, I don't call that a fault.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> No, I daresay not, but I know
nothing about that, of course, as my relations with
him have been entirely on a business footing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Your relations with him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Yes, we have been exchanging
letters for the last week.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Exchanging letters for the last week!
[<i>With a sudden idea&mdash;aside</i>]. Ha! can it be that&mdash;no&mdash;it
is not possible!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> You'd never guess what subject
he's been corresponding with me about&mdash;not quite the
sort of thing you'd expect from a Duke.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>aside</i>]. I really believe it is! [<i>Aloud</i>]
Can it be the subject we were speaking about just now?
Is it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Cooking? Yes, it is! Now what
do you think of that for the Duke of Peckham Rye?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Madam, [<i>with emotion</i>] your words almost
convince me that what I have been expecting is
a certainty&mdash;yes, I have guessed your secret!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>amazed</i>]. My secret. [<i>With an
idea</i>]. Oh, you have guessed that what you are trying
for, I am very near to?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>bewildered</i>]. What I am trying for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Well, then, to speak plainly&mdash;Princess
Blakowska.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>excited</i>]. Ah! You admit how nearly the
mention of that name has touched you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> What's the use of denying
it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> No good! It would be useless, for my
heart tells me too surely that I am right.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Your heart! What's that got
to do with it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> From the moment you spoke, I was interested
in you. It began to dawn on me who you
were&mdash;you spoke of being abroad in foreign watering
places&mdash;interested in cookery. A wild thought darted
into my mind, but I hardly dared to hope. [<span class="smallcaps">Mrs
Jennings</span> <i>alarmed</i>]. Then you told me of your correspondence
with the Duke, and my heart filled with
delight.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>alarmed, aside</i>]. The man is
mad, I do believe!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Now I know that you are she whom I
have been seeking! Oh, what unlooked for happiness!
You are the Princess Blakowska!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> I, the Princess Blakowska!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Yes, I have discovered your secret&mdash;don't
try to conceal it any more.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>terrified, looks at him</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> You are, aren't you? Oh, say I am
right!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>humouring&mdash;heartily</i>]. Of course,
yes, of course! I am the Princess Blakowska.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Oh, what unlooked for good fortune!
That after thinking of you, dreaming of you, going
across London to seek you in vain, Providence should
bring us together!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings</span> [<i>aside</i>]. This is horrible! He is
quite out of his mind! Oh, what shall I do? Where
is the cord of communication with the guard! Outside
that window probably! [<i>Aloud</i>]. I feel a little
faint&mdash;I should like to have some air. [<i>Goes to

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke</span> [<i>aside</i>]. How curiously she takes it! She

you will never forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Duke.</span> Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Mrs Jennings.</span> Susan Jennings! Yes! Oh,

you were somebody else? You said you were a

to your house at Grosvenor Gardens, and you were out,
